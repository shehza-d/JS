      Random Paragraph For those who are interested in finding random
      paragraphs, that's exactly what this webpage provides. If both a random
      word and a random sentence aren't quite long enough for your needs, then a
      random paragraph might be the perfect solution. Once you arrive at this
      page, you'll see a random paragraph. If you need another one, all you need
      to do is click on the "next paragraph" button. If you happen to need
      several random paragraphs all at once, you can use this other paragraph
      generator. Below you can find a number of ways that this generator can be
      used. Text Blocks There are a number of reasons you may need a block of
      text and when you do, a random paragraph can be the perfect solution. If
      you happen to be a web designer and you need some random text to show in
      your layout, a random paragraph can be an excellent way to do this. If
      you're a programmer and you need random text to test the program, using
      these paragraphs can be the perfect way to do this. Anyone who's in search
      of realistic text for a project can use one or more of these random
      paragraphs to fill their need. Improve Writing For writers looking for a
      way to get their creative writing juices flowing, using a random paragraph
      can be a great way to do this. One of the great benefits of this tool is
      that nobody knows what is going to appear in the paragraph. This can be
      leveraged in a few different ways to force the writer to use creativity.
      For example, the random paragraph can be used as the beginning paragraph
      of a story that the writer must finish. I can also be used as a paragraph
      somewhere inside a short story, or for a more difficult creative
      challenge, it can be used as the ending paragraph. In every case, the
      writer is forced to use creativity to incorporate the random paragraph
      into the story. Rewriting Skills For some writers, it isn't getting the
      original words on paper that's the challenge, but rewriting the first and
      second drafts. Using the random paragraph generator can be a good way to
      get into a rewriting routine before beginning the project. In this case,
      you take the random paragraph and rewrite it so it retains the same
      meaning, but does so in a better and more concise way. Beginning the day
      doing this with a random paragraph can make the rewriting of an article,
      short story, or chapter of a book much easier than trying to begin
      directly with it. Overcome Writers' Block When it comes to writers' block,
      often the most difficult part is simply beginning to put words to paper.
      One way that can often help is to write about something completely
      different from what you're having the writers' block about. This is where
      a random paragraph can be quite helpful. By using this tool you can begin
      to chip away at the writers' block by simply adding to the random
      paragraph that appears with the knowledge that it's going to be completely
      different from any writing you've been doing. Then once you begin to put
      words on the paper, it should be easier to transition into the writing
      that needs to get done. Difficult Writing Challenge For those who are
      looking for a difficult writing challenge, the random paragraph generator
      can provide that as well. Instead of writing about the entire paragraph,
      take each sentence in the paragraph and make each of those individual
      sentences the first or last sentence of each paragraph of a short story.
      Trying this difficult writing challenge should stretch your creativity to
      the limit. The best way to use these random paragraphs is to generate a
      few and see how they can help with whatever project you're currently
      pursuing. You should be able to figure out quickly if this tool will be
      beneficial for your project or needs. Often times the best way to see if
      it's what you've been looking for is to use it and find out for yourself.
